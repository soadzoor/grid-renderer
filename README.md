# GridCanvas
A simple canvas-based grid visualizer for large data sets

Instructions:
- Clicking on a cell will turn it into the "active cell" (border becomes green)
- You can change the active cell by clicking on another cell, or using the arrow keys on your keyboard
- Move your mouse around while holding the right button on the canvas to pan the viewport ("camera") on the grid
- Check "Main.ts" for further examples on how to use the component
